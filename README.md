# WALMART-STORE-SALES-PREDICTIONS-Python-
Data from Walmart stores accross the US is given, and it is up to us to forecast their weekly sales. The data is already split into a training and a test set, and we want to fit a model to the training data that is able to forecast those weeks sales as accurately as possible. In fact, our metric of interest will be the Mean Absolute Error.
